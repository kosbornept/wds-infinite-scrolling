# Infinite Scrolling

Tutorial followed from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZKUirTtxcg)

Implementing infinite scrolling with API book data in a react app.

## Usage

Use the input to search for a book title. The [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/) will return a list of book titles, filtering out duplicate titles from different publishers. Scroll down the list and the app will mark loading, before allowing infinite scrolling to continue.
